This phase was very useful to get all the informations needed to implement the application. We have now a precise idea of the work that has to be done. Everyone in the group has already wrote some lines in Ruby during this phase. We're ready to start the implementation phase.\\

In this report, it was asked to specify which group member worked on which part. Everyone in the group took part in every subject studied here. Nevertheless, we gave responsibilities to specific topics to each member of the group. Benoit, Vincent, Alex and Pierre-Yves worked more on diagrams. Matthieu and Ludovic found informations for testing the application. Benjamin was in charge to complete the conventions part of the report. Julien, as the leader, managed the work and discussions. %% Julien s'est bien touch√©!
