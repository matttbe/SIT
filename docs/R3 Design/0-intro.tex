In this third phase of the project, the objective was to go deeper in all subjects approached in the architecture report. A simple way to reach this objective was to continue work done previously. \\

Because of our lack of knowledge in the framework we chose, we decided to implement a very simple system in Rails to understand the MVC pattern in RoR. Two members of the group created a sample for Solidare-IT website with a simple user connection. With these new informations, we changed our sequence diagrams to make them more in relation with the real application. We made some changes in the ORM and class diagrams. \\
We tried to give rectifications corresponding to the comments we received in the feedback. \\
