On the ORM diagram, we added a few elements. First, we added new kinds of \texttt{User}. We did this to show the different kind of users accounts that can be created beside the 'simple user' : \begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{Coworker}. A user who works for an organisation and can manage different users by creating their account and manage services for them.
\item The \texttt{Moderator}. A user who manages a special category of services.
\end{itemize}
Secondly, we put the new field of service, which is called \texttt{Quick}. It's already explained earlier in this report.
