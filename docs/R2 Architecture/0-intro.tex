In this phase, we will go further in the refelexion about the project. Indeed, we have to do an ORM scheme,
an UML scheme and some sequence diagrams. So after that, we will have concretely the structure of the 
database and the program in mind.

This will make easier the third phase, we will just have to follow the structure which will be decided 
now to really design the application.

We will also choose the framework to use. It's important to enquire about the different solutions existing. 
To do an efficient choice, we will compare different framework and choose the one that seems to be the
most adapted to our need. We will also see the knowledge of the members of the group. This will be to take
in account in our choice.
