This work was the occasion to learn on one hand about software technology and on the other to improve our working organisation in a larger team than usual.
On this phase, our leader took his job very seriously by organizing and leading in meetings.
We also are more efficient with our collaborative development tools Trello and writeLatex.\\

We improve our experience of separating the work that has to be done in different parts.
We had to give back a consistent report so communication between us becomes really important.
To reach the goal before the deadline, we had to separate the job in different tasks attributed to subgroups.
In these subgroups working on different diagrams, we can still create responsibilities like two persons drawing the diagram on a white board and the third one transcript it into virtual file usable on the computer.\\

Now that we have a better module decomposition, we have a view on the time required to achieve this project.
The module decomposition allows us to improve the separation of the responsibilities. We hope that we gave you a better look on the project.
We have now a clear idea on what the application will be.
On development part, we have already thought about the minimal requirements of this architecture and we have also some ideas in our pockets to push the application .


%%We learn to DO NOT put exclamation mark in a technical document!
