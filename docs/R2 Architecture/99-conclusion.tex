What do we learn in this phase of the project?\\
First, we become to see more precisely the construction of the website. As the goal of this phase was to think about the architecture, we can know see how the objects will be lenked together and how the user will really interact on the website.\\
Secondly, the ORM provide us a better view on the future database we will have to implement.\\
Thirdly, working in group of eight persons is not so easy. We improve our experience of separating the work that has to be done in different parts. We have to give back a consistent report so communication between us become really important. To reach the goal before the deadline, we had to separate the job in different task attribute to subgroup. In those subgroups, working on different diagram, we can still create responsabilities like to persons drawing the diagram on a white board and the third one transcript it into virtual file usable on the computer.\\
