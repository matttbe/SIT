We want to say that this first report was helpful for us to really see the scale of the project.\\

% tapis vert du savoir

First, users stories allowed us to think about the project in details.
Then, activity diagrams gave us the possibility to see the link between all the elements of a frame and between the frames themselves.

%Each seance with the group was the occasion to speak about the \emph{congolexicomatisation}.

We tried for the first time the \emph{waterfall model} and we were reticent about using it. Indeed, we preferred the spontaneity of the \emph{Agile model} but, in this case, it seems very appropriate to use the \emph{waterfall model} so that the client can see if our vision of the project match his. Moreover, the client can report any problem very early, before we go too deep into development.
