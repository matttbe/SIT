In this first report, we describe the first step of our development project following the waterfall model: the requirements. It means that we have listed all features that will be implemented in our project. This will be done by taking into account the different users that might use the system. All actions that users want to find on our website are listed as user stories.

We have analysed the requirements and used them to draw activity diagrams and to write user stories to show up the main functions of our website. The activity diagrams are graphical tools showing interactions between a user and the application we have to design. A user story is a kind of scenario that a user of the system does or needs to do.\\

In addition to that, we also enumerate a few non-functional requirements that describe how the system should handle all the functionalities.
